This Project was just made so I could contribute to the community a bit.

It doesnt mention using getcomponents and making an array of colliders
I assume this would array the colliders in order top to bottom on how they are positioned
in the inspector. Then maybe you could identify them some how.

Maybe looking into how they work with listners and delegates using sololearn resources
on C# you may be able to differente some how. For instance OnTriggerEnter
refers to any trigger but maybe different triggers could have different parameters
they pass and so get picked up by different methods.
